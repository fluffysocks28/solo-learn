Notes for the "Basic Concepts" section of SoloLearn Javascript course.

--- Variables ---
Store full number values (var firstNum = 10; / var secondNum = 20; / firstNum + secondNum; [=30])

The (=) sign is an assignment operator. (x = y will assign the value of 'x' to 'y')

Variables are now better assigned with 'let' or 'const' rather than 'var'

--- Data Types ---
