Notes for the "Basic Concepts" section of SoloLearn Javascript course.

--- Variables ---
Store full number values (var firstNum = 10; / var secondNum = 20; / firstNum + secondNum; [=30])

The (=) sign is an assignment operator. (x = y will assign the value of 'x' to 'y')

Variables are now better assigned with 'let' or 'const' rather than 'var'

--- Data Types ---
Data type refers to Numbers, Booleans, Strings, Arrays etc

Variables can be both full numbers and floating numbers (var x = 18; var y = 13.23;)
Strings are any text that appears within quotes (var name = 'Raymond';)
-- to place quotes within a string you must use a [\]. (var name = "my name is \'Raymond\'";)
Booleans can be a value of 'true' or 'false' (var answerCorrect = true;)

--- Math Operators ---
+ = addition | - = subtraction | * = multiplication | / = division | % = modulus | ++ = increment | -- = decrement.
